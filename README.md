# S.L.E.S
It is a System of Linear Equation Solver, which given the input of coefficient in the system and the number of equations in the system, provides all sorts of information about the system, like the echelon form, augmented matrix form, their rank, homogeneity of the system, information about its consistency and the solution for that system.

this project is build using basics of C language in CodeBlocks IDE.

to run, just download the file and run it in your compilor.

the first input it takes is the number of coefficients in the system,
for example, in the equation x^2 + 2*x + 5=0 has 3 coefficients, 1(from x^2), 2(from x^1) and 5(from x^0).
the second input it asks for is the number of equations in the system.
then it requests the values of the coefficients of each equation sequentially.

Just input that, and it will provide you with a whole lot of information about the system.
